### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm studying Mathematics and Data Analysis at Warsaw University of technology at faculty of Mathematics and Information Technology.  
At the end of september I ended my carrier as a frontend (Angular) developer (temporarily or permanently? I'm not sure). 
Currently, if time allows, I'm looking for opportunities to develop my skills in data analysis / data science.  
The repo is to gather my recent data analysis projects. I have also an old repo [HERE](https://github.com/Arcywojak) which mostly concerns front end.
